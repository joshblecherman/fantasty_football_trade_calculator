Fantasy Points Tracker - 2024 Draft
====================================

This table shows average points for the following draft brackets in the 2024 draft.
QBs are excluded from calculations. The first half of the first round is considered a separate bracket,
because this is where "unkeepables" and high 1st round rookies are drafted. Everything past the first round
is excluded but results are below.

1.1-1.6, mean=217.65

1.7-1.12, mean=184.52

2.1-2.12, mean=166.56

3.1-3.12, mean=172.44

4.1-4.12, mean=128.88

5.1-5.12, mean=146.02
